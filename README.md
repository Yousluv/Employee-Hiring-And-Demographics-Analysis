# Employee-Hiring-And-Demographics-Analysis
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing employee hiring trends, demographic distributions, compensation patterns, and departmental salary insights across a multinational organization. The aim is to uncover meaningful patterns and provide actionable recommendations based on workforce data visualization. 
## Overview
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of various human resources metrics. These include top earners, hiring trends, gender and ethnic diversity, average salaries, and departmental performance by compensation. The data is visualized in an intuitive format using bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for better stakeholder understanding.

-	Who are the top-performing and best-paid employees?
-	Which departments and roles attract the highest salaries?
-	Are hiring patterns consistent or improving?
-	How diverse is the workforce by gender, ethnicity, and geography?

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
The raw dataset underwent the following transformations:
